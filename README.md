# simple_carwash
This is a script that offers fivem players a simple and free to use carwash.  Simply place it in your resources folder (in it's own directory) and put the name of that directory into your server.cfg file.  Now your users can drive to one of 5 car wash locations and get a free wash and shine!  Pretty simple.  

It works because it's framework independent (EssentialMode, vRP, etc etc).  As it doesn't require the player's information to have them pay.  And the other nice thing is that it's a client only script since there isn't any need for the server's input, thereby not using server resources to lookup player's wallets and such.
